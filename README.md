# Java Design Patterns
This repository is used for learning design patterns my way. I have seen too much tutorials online using Animals and Shapes as illustrations or pseudocode to teach software design patterns and because of this, at least for me, there is no real world example to appreciate them.

So I came up with my own using real world examples. I hope these come useful to others as they have for me in appreciating and understanding the essence of these design patterns and how they CAN be used in real coding.

## Creational Patterns
### 1. Abstract Factory
**Scenario**: A payment gateway where a user has different options for payment method.

### 2. Builder
**Scenario**: A customer would like to order a meal from a fast food chain and would have multiple ways to complete his/her meal.

### 3. Prototype
**Scenario**: Using a spreadsheet application, a user can duplicate the contents of a cell to another.

### 4. Singleton
**Scenario**: Creating a single instance of a database connection to make sure connection pool is not used up.
